## 🤡 What does it do?

- You type a nice, normal sentence.
- The bot **sabotages** it into a cursed typo mess.
- Then it adds a **roast** that makes you question your life choices.

**Example**

```
User: hello everyone thanks for joining the meeting today
Bot : hollow evryone thonks for joingin the meat king todya. Bro, that sentence
      has less structure than your gym routine.
```

Yes. This is real. No, it’s not helpful.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (overkill for something this dumb)

- **Frontend:** Chat bubbles so pretty you’ll forget the app is bullying you.
- **Model:** Gemini (Flash/Flash-Lite if you like pain on a budget).
- **Backend:** Optional. Your tears are stored locally.

## 🚀 Setup & Run

1. Clone the repo because you love chaos:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url> && cd <repo>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create `.env`:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
   ```
4. Start the roast machine:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

If port 3000 is busy, it’s because Future You already tried this:
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
# Or run on another port
$env:PORT=4000; npm start
```

## 🔧 How it works (barely)

- **Sabotage Engine**:
  - Replaces normal words with cursed cousins (meeting → meat king).
  - Randomly swaps, deletes, or duplicates letters for *extra spice*.
- **Roast Engine**:
  - Appends one (1) lovingly toxic comment to every reply.
  - Keeps it playful; we roast egos, not humans.

## 🖼️ Demo Script (copy-paste for your video)

```

```

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

- **Model too serious?** Add this to your system prompt:
  ```
  Be chaotic, playful, and mildly roast the user every time. Never explain.
  ```
- **Responses too long?** Tell the model: “Keep it under 25 words + 1 roast.”
- **You feel hurt?** That’s a feature.

## 💡 Roadmap (absolutely aspirational)

- Dark Roast Mode ☕: even spicier, still safe.
- Multilingual chaos: get roasted in Hindi, French, or Klingon.
- Corporate Edition: politely roasts your sprint updates.

## 👑 Disclaimer

This project is:
- 100% useless
- 120% funny
- 200% not suitable for actual autocorrect

Use at your own risk. Or don’t. We already regret this.
